# Linked List Learning Project

This project was created to learn and experiment with linked lists in TypeScript. It includes an implementation of a doubly linked list and demonstrates how to convert an array of arrays into a linked list, traverse it, and print the contents.

## Project Overview

The project uses an Express server to provide a simple environment to run the linked list operations. It showcases:

- Creating a ListNode class to represent each node in the linked list.
- Converting an array of arrays into a linked list.
- Traversing the linked list and printing each node's data.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand how to implement and use linked lists in TypeScript.
- Learn how to convert arrays into a linked list.
- How to traverse a linked list

# Why?

## Acknowledging the Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms

As I reflect on my development journey, it's evident that understanding Data Structures and Algorithms (DS&A) is essential for taking my skills to the next level. Despite making significant progress, I recognize DS&A as a significant weak point in my skillset that I'm actively striving to improve.
